This is my first project written in HTML in the recent ongoing Pre-HNG internship program. The aim of this internship is to train students to be proficient in Backend, frontend and ML development.

After concluding my first lecture in Html, I was given a project task to create and update my Cv using all the skills and knowledge of html.

With the skills so far, I was able to create a webpage of my Cv using Html
