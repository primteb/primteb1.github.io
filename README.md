This is my first project in the recent HNG intership program. The aim of this intership is to train students to be proficient in Backend, frontend and ML development.

After concluding my first lecture in Html, I was give a project task to create and update my Cv using all the skills and knowledge of html.

With the skills so far, I was able to create a webpage of my Cv using Html
